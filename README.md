#  ھىكمەتلەر خەزىنىسى (Wisdom Treasure)
Welcome to the ھىكمەتلەر خەزىنىسى (Wisdom Treasure) app, which lets you fetch random sayings from different sources. It allows the user to select a category and get a random saying from that category. 
This is for the people who speak Uyghurs.
The available categories are:
- Quran verse
- Hadith
- Uyghur language sayings
- English famous sayings

The saying is generated randomly each time the user clicks the "Get a saying" button.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## 🏫 Challenges and Solutions

1. Fetching data from different APIs:
One of the main challenges in this project was to fetch data from different APIs and display it on the HTML page. Each API had a different format and structure for its data, which required me to read the API documentation carefully and understand the data format before making any requests. Additionally, I had to handle errors and unexpected responses from the API, which required me to write robust and error-proof code. By following best practices and testing the code thoroughly, I was able to successfully fetch data from all the APIs and display it on the page.

2. Configuring font family for different types of language texts:
Another challenge I faced was configuring the font family for different types of language texts. As this project includes sayings in different languages such as Uyghur and English, I had to ensure that the text was displayed correctly and with the right font. This required me to do some research and understand the different font families available for each language. By adding the appropriate font families to the CSS code, I was able to display the text correctly in each language.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me. It helped me develop my skills in web development, including working with APIs, handling different types of data, and configuring font families for different languages.

## 🤔 Lesson Learned
While building this app, I learned how to:

- Use external APIs to fetch data and display it in HTML
- Generate a random number in JavaScript
- Use while loops and conditional statements to convert total verse numbers to surah numbers and verse numbers in surah in the Quran API

### Additional Feature
I added an additional feature that generates a random Quran verse. The verse number is generated randomly between 1 and 6236, and then the corresponding surah and verse numbers are calculated based on the total verse number. The verse is then fetched from the Quran API and displayed on the page. This was a challenging but rewarding feature to implement as it required working with complex data structures and calculations.
